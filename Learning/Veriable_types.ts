// this is  print command

console.log("Hello World");

// we have created variable named "word" with string type

let word = "Hello World";

console.log(word);

// now we will create variable with boolean type

let b = true;

// now we will create variable with number type

let c = 56;

// now will create variable with any type which should 
// not be used in any case as typescript will not be validated by typescript


let d;

d="teacher";
d=2

// If you dont know the value of any variable use the type for signification

let e:string;

e="ab"

// as defined e type as string will not allow to update number type

e=5
